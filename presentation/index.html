# .center[History of testing]

### *.center[„How to engineer a bug free solution?”]*
This question has been on the minds of engineers since before the times the computers were invented.

Originally the term „bug” was used in reference to hardware engineering and electrical circuits, 
most likely since at least 1870s and was originally used to describe malfunctions and glitches in such systems. [1]

Most famous case of that is perhaps that of an actual bug - a moth - trapped in the relay of the Mark II computer system in 1946. 
In the later report authored by the operators who found the moth - there’s a statement that 
it’s a „First actual case of bug being found”. [1]

## .center[Software bugs]

With time, when hardware programming was replaced by software programing, 
meaning of the term shifted towards what we know it to be today - an undesired, faulty behavior of the software.

---

### *.center[„Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.”]*
.right[D. Knuth]

In the early days of computer programming, when programmers were actually good at mathematics, 
there emerged a practice to develop formal program specifications. 
As common in other engineering disciplines, language of mathematics is used to state the problem and provide a concrete solution. Then, by applying techniques of formal verification, a design - and by extension an implementation - can be proved correct. [1][2]

It fell out of use due to not being really practical and very rigid. 
It also required a great deal of mathematical expertise from the programmers. As programs grew larger this practice was almost entirely abandoned.

---

## .center[How software testing came to be?]

It’s hard to determine exact point in time software testing emerged. In its early form it dates very far back. 
However, it can be said that in 1990s, the heavy waterfall approach with its methodologies started to decline in significance in favor of new agile approach, 
which favors flexibility [3]. 
Formal methods of verification were slowly replaced by automated tests which both state the requirement as well as prove correctness of the code under testing.

The year 1997 marks the release of JUnit 1.0, a Java unit testing framework which is the de facto standard defining the approach to unit testing [4]. 
Soon after there was a boom of new testing methodologies and frameworks and the pursuit for better ways of testing started for good. 

---
## .center[Where are we now?]

Twenty five years later there’s multiple different testing libraries and frameworks for every significant programming language that there is. 

.center[`* insert refrence to the list> *`]

The practice of test driven development emerged. 
We have unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, contract testing, api testing, 
parametrized testing, mutation testing, exploratory testing, fuzz testing and many more!

# .center[xUnit style testing]

Let’s dive right in and see few examples of unit tests in different languages and frameworks.

- If N % 5 == 0 > Buzz
- If both > FizzBuzz
- Else: N

```Java
class AppTest {
    @Test 
    void getMessageCaseOneThenReturnValue() {
        App klass = new App();
        String expected = "1";
        String actual = klass.getMessage(1);
        assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }

    @Test 
    void getMessageCaseThreeThenReturnFizz() {
        App klass = new App();
        String expected = "Fizz";
        String actual = klass.getMessage(3);
        assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }

    @Test 
    void getMessageCaseFiveThenReturnBuzz() {
        App klass = new App();
        String expected = "Buzz";
        String actual = klass.getMessage(5);
        assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }

    @Test 
    void getMessageCaseFifteenThenReturnFizzBuzz () {
        App klass = new App();
        String expected = "FizzBuzz";
        String actual = klass.getMessage(15);
        assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }
}

  test('case 1 then return 1', () => {
    const expected = '1';
    const actual = fizzBuzz(1);

    expect(actual).toBe(expected);
  });

  test('case 3 then return Fizz', () => {
    const expected = 'Fizz';
    const actual = fizzBuzz(3);

    expect(actual).toBe(expected);
  });

  test('case 5 then return Buzz', () => {
    const expected = 'Buzz';
    const actual = fizzBuzz(5);

    expect(actual).toBe(expected);
  });

  test('case 15 then return FizzBuzz', () => {
    const expected = 'FizzBuzz';
    const actual = fizzBuzz(15);

    expect(actual).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```
???
This is Jest. 
Although it appears different, same elements can be identified here.
---
```python
class TestFizzBuzz(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_get_message_case_one_then_return_it(self):
        expected = "1"
        actual = fizzbuzz.get_message(1)

        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)

    def test_get_message_case_three_then_return_fizz(self):
        expected = "Fizz"
        actual = fizzbuzz.get_message(3)

        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)

    def test_get_message_case_five_then_return_buzz(self):
        expected = "Buzz"
        actual = fizzbuzz.get_message(5)

        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)

    def test_get_message_case_fifteen_then_return_fizzbuzz(self):
        expected = "FizzBuzz"
        actual = fizzbuzz.get_message(15)

        self.assertEqual(expected, actual)
```

Next up: python using unittest library. Striking resemblance ot JUnit and in fact some people used to call this PyUnit.

Pytest library.
We'll use that in the future examples

---

We can immediately observe that despite obvious syntax differences all these test suites are quite similar in structure. 
In fact there’s a set of certain conventions that most testing environments follow. 
In all these test suites we can clearly identify the test cases and the assertions. 
The de facto standard emerged from the SUnit/JUnit and testing frameworks that follow these design principles are collectively called xUnit frameworks. [5]
???
Pytest library. 

Explain the point of this excercise:
- it transcends language
- knowledge is applicable everywhere
- same patterns and principles apply to FE/BE and any other type of applications
- there are other approaches like BDD, there are other libraries for E2E - they live a bit outside, we'll leave them for now. 

We'll use that in the future.

# .center[What makes a great unit test?]

### *.center["A well-written program is its own Heaven; a poorly-written program is its own Hell."]*
.right[The Tao of Programming]

Relying on the testing framework isn’t enough to guarantee that the tests we are developing will automatically be good. 
It is up to the programmer to guarantee quality of the test suite. But what makes for a good test really? In the book „Testing rails” [6] 
the authors identified key characteristics of an effective test suite. The tests should be:

- Fast
- Complete
- Reliable
- Isolated
- Maintainable
- Expressive

???
FCRIME acronym

---

## .center[Okay. So how do I know my tests are good enough?]

How to tell whether tests meet all those requirements? Unfortunately, 
there aren’t any set rules that say for example „your tests should run in under X ms each” or „your tests should cover X % of code 
to be considered complete” etc. 

When trying ot assert quality of the tests it’s useful 
to see the requirements as a continuum on which they lie. 
In my opinion, it’s practical to use common sense when deciding on when a test is good enough.

---

## .center[Couple of examples]

- Integration tests will never be as fast as unit tests. What may be a slow time for a unit test can be absolutely okay for an integration test.
- It’s very hard to have 100% coverage. Should you also cover 3rd party dependencies with your tests? Should you write tests that test the language itself? In reality you need to draw the line somewhere.
- Sometimes it’s not wrong to have lots of tests run on a database. If the tests are fast and your framework enables it - like Django does for example - then you shouldn’t go out of your way to mock the database in every test. Other times you really want to have the tests truly isolated.
- Sometimes it’s okay to have some duplication in the tests rather than to have a poor abstraction
- It’s fine for some of the e2e or integration tests to be more than few lines of code. But generally - you don’t want your tests to be more than few lines of code.

---

class: middle

As you can see - answering the question „Are the tests good?” can depend on many things. 
It’s still useful to have those guidelines in mind. 
Having that out of the way, let’s now explore ways to make tests as good as possible!

---

## .center[Clean tests]

In his fantastic book, „Clean code” [7], Robert Martin stressed out the concept of code cleanliness as a quality in itself. 
Obviously, it can be extended to tests and, in fact, Uncle Bob states that readability is what makes them clean. Although, 
it goes without saying that all the „clean code” rules also apply. 
To illustrate some key rules we will perform an excercise of taking some totally „dirty” tests and examine them.

---

## .center[Example 1]
### .center[The "anything" test]

```python
class TestLibrary:
    def test_business_methods(self):
        business = LibraryBusiness()
        book = Book('Do androids dream of electric sheep?', 'Philip K. Dick', None, None)
        account = Account('jsmith@example.com', 'John Smith')
        business.rent(book, to=account)

        assert book.rented_by == account
        assert book.return_due_date

        business.make_return(book)
        assert book.rented_by is None

        business.rent(book, to=account)
        other = Account('randy@example.com', 'Randy Marsh')

        with pytest.raises(Exception):
            business.rent(to=other)
```

???
Whats wrong?

- That type of smell can describe different parts of the test. What it refers to is ambiguity of a test.
- Unclear naming - hard to guess what it does - not [M]aintainable
- Lots of data irrelevant to the logic being tested; duplications - [M]aintainable, not [E]xpressive
- Broken [I]solation
- Assertions not precise - not [R]eliable
- Broken flow - setting stuff up is mixed with code execution and assertions not - [M]antainable
- It'd be hard to know what's wrong if the test - not [R]eliable

---

## .center[Example 1 improved]

```python
class TestLibraryBusiness:
    @pytest.fixture
    def business(self, fake_library_policy, mocker):
        business = LibraryBusiness()
        return business

    def test_rent_case_book_not_rented_then_mark_it_rented_by(self, business, book, account):
        business.rent(book, to=account)
        assert book.rented_by == account

    def test_rent_case_rented_already_then_raise_error(self, business, book_factory, account):
        book = book_factory(is_rented=True)

        with pytest.raises(errors.BookRentedAlready):
            business.rent(book, to=account)

    def test_make_return_always_clear_book_rented_at(self, business, book_factory):
        book = book_factory(is_rented=True)
        business.make_return(book)
        assert book.rented_by is None

    def test_make_return_always_clear_return_due_date(self, business, book_factory):
        book = book_factory(is_rented=True)
        business.make_return(book)
        assert book.return_due_date is None
```
???
Explain what was done:
- Naming conventions - Given-When-Then pattern
- Structure of a test - Arange-Act-Assert pattern
- De-duplication - use factories, factory methods, fixtures to get rid of things that aren't differentiators for a test
- One concept per test
- One assertion per test?

---

## .center[Example 1 - factories]

```python
@register
class BookFactory(factory.Factory):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Book

    title = factory.Faker('word', part_of_speech='noun')
    author = factory.Faker('name_nonbinary')

    class Params:
        is_rented = factory.Trait(
            rented_by=factory.SubFactory('tests.factories.AccountFactory'),
            return_due_date=factory.Faker('future_date', end_date='+14d')
        )
        is_overdue = factory.Trait(
            rented_by=factory.SubFactory('tests.factories.AccountFactory'),
            return_due_date=factory.Faker('past_date')
        )
```

???
It's not relevant what kind of factories you use - can be homebrewed - it's important to use any.
Especially in data-driven systems!

- Discuss factory antipatterns
- optionals None by default > reduce flakiness
- enumerations default too

---

## .center[Takeaways]

- Naming conventions - Given-When-Then pattern
- Structure of a test - Arange-Act-Assert pattern
- De-duplication - use factories, factory methods, fixtures to get rid of things that aren't differentiators for a test
- One concept per test
- One assertion per test?

---

## .center[Example 2]
### .center[The mocker]

```pytest
def test_overdue(self, book, account, mocker):
    business = LibraryBusiness()
    mocker.patch('src.library.domain.policies.complex_rental_period_calculation', return_value=10)
    business.rent(book, to=account)
    assert book.return_due_date == dt.date.today() + dt.timedelta(days=10)
```

???
Whats wrong this time? It appears rather okay.

Well, it's the misuse of mocks:
- We test implementation
- We introduce constraints -> refactoring policies module would break A LOT OF TESTS
- That smell also indicates problem in the SUT -> coupled architecture
- Surely, there must be a better way?

---

## .center[Example 2 - preparing the fix]

```python
def complex_rental_period_calculation() -> int:
    # let's pretend this depends on many factors and system configuration
    return 14


class LibraryPolicy(Protocol):
    def get_rental_period_length_days(self) -> int:
        raise NotImplementedError


class _LibraryPolicyImpl:
    def get_rental_period_length_days(self) -> int:
        return complex_rental_period_calculation()


def create_library_policy():
    return _LibraryPolicyImpl()
```

???

There is! We can use design patterns and general rules of good programing to our advantage.

When we improve code design we're then able to use our own fake. Expand on what we did:
- We introduced an abstraction
- We've cut the dependency - as the business class now knows only of the interface
- We will provide a fake implementation to the interface
- The default implementation is still there - a factory will return it

---

## .center[Example 2 - preparing the fix, pt. 2]

```python
class LibraryBusiness:
    def __init__(self):
        self._policy: policies.LibraryPolicy = policies.create_library_policy()


    def set_library_policy(self, policy: policies.LibraryPolicy):
        self._policy = policy

    ...
```

???
We opted for a dependency injection via setter. In the class under test we replaced direct call with
the policy.

We can now freely replace the dependency in the tests the tests.

---

## .center[Example 2 fixed]

```python
class TestLibraryBusiness:
    @pytest.fixture
    def fake_library_policy(self):
        def factory(rental_period_length=14):
            class FakePolicy:
                def get_rental_period_length_days(self) -> int:
                    return rental_period_length

            return FakePolicy()

        return factory

    @pytest.fixture
    def business(self, fake_library_policy, mocker):
        business = LibraryBusiness()
        business.set_library_policy(fake_library_policy())
        return business

    @pytest.mark.parametrize('period', [14, 28])
    def test_rent_case_can_rent_then_set_return_due_date(self, business, book, account, fake_library_policy, period):
        business.set_library_policy(fake_library_policy(period))
        business.rent(book, to=account)
        assert book.return_due_date == dt.date.today() + dt.timedelta(days=period)
```

???

There is! We can use design patterns and general rules of good programing to our advantage.

When we improve code design we're then able to use our own fake. We also used existing factory fixture to provide
a stub right away.

Notice this: even if there was 100 tests that rely on the policy we can update the fixtures and have all 100 fixed.

A huge improvement compared to mocks!

Note the parametrization as well!

---

## Takeaways

- Mocking in tests often is a code smell
- Good architecture results in testable code. Especially useful are:
    - factories/factory methods and other creational patterns
    - dependency injection
    - interfaces/protocols/abstract classes
- When in doubt - abstract away!
- Prefer testing results over testing the implementation

---

### Example 3
## .center[The "I could assert results as well" test]

```python
def test_notification(self, book, account, mocker):
    business = LibraryBusiness()
    business.rent(book, to=account)
    book.return_due_date = dt.date.fromisoformat('1900-01-01')
    spy = mocker.spy(notifications, name='external_api_call')
    business.send_overdue_notification(book)
    spy.assert_called_once()
```

???

Here an attempt to check whether external notification api was made.
It still didn't change the fact that it was indeed called. 
This means that the dependency is still there so the test isn't [F]ast nor [I]solated.
We could decide this is an integration test or we could actually mock if it's inconvenient to call that service.

---

## Example 3 - preparation

```python
# notifications.py 

def external_api_call(email, message):
    # let's pretend this function calls 3rd party api
    print("External API called!")
    return


class NotificationService(Protocol):
    def send_email(self, email, message):
        raise NotImplementedError


class _NotificationServiceImpl(NotificationService):
    def send_email(self, email, message):
        # it's a nice place to do required pre-formatting of the data
        # before calling the externals
        return external_api_call(email, message)


def create_notification_service() -> NotificationService:
    return _NotificationServiceImpl()
```

???
Same drill - we abstract away the extenrals.

---

## Example 3 - preparation, pt. 2


```python
# business.py

class LibraryBusiness:
    def __init__(self):
        self._policy: policies.LibraryPolicy = policies.create_library_policy()
        self._notifications: notifications.NotificationService = notifications.create_notification_service()

    def set_library_policy(self, policy: policies.LibraryPolicy):
        self._policy = policy

    def set_notification_service(self, service: notifications.NotificationService):
        self._notifications = service
```

---

## Example 2 - fixed

```python
class TestLibraryBusiness:
    ...

    @pytest.fixture
    def business(self, fake_library_policy, mocker):
        business = LibraryBusiness()

        business.set_library_policy(fake_library_policy())
        business.set_notification_service(mocker.create_autospec(notifications.NotificationService))

        return business

    def test_send_overdue_notification_case_book_is_overdue_then_send_email(self, business, book_factory, mocker):
        mock = mocker.create_autospec(notifications.NotificationService)
        business.set_notification_service(mock)
        book = book_factory(is_overdue=True)

        business.send_overdue_notification(book)

        mock.send_email.assert_called_with(book.rented_by.email, mocker.ANY)
```

???

We used a mock to actually check whether the contract between the business is held.

Since calling the service is a side effect then we have to use a mock.
We can write our own or we can use a library one.

It's not the same to the Example 2 though - again -> notice decoupling
